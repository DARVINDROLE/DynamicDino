# WnW – Wellness Within

**WnW (Wellness Within)** is a smart emotional wellbeing app that helps users understand how their physical activity, screen time, sleep, and music choices affect their mood. It uses Google Fit, screen usage data, and Spotify listening behavior to calculate a personalized wellbeing score and generate health tips — powered by a machine learning model.

---

## Why WnW?

India faces a growing mental health crisis. Most people can't spot early signs of stress or depression, therapy is costly or unavailable, and stigma stops them from seeking help. Health data is scattered across apps, leaving no clear picture of overall mental well-being — especially in rural communities.

WnW empowers users to take control of their emotional wellbeing by reflecting their habits back to them with insight — not just numbers. It turns smartphones into 24/7 culturally-aware wellness companions, offering affordable, stigma-free, and proactive mental health monitoring.

> **Important:** To track fitness data accurately, please ensure your smartwatch is connected to **Google Fit** via your watch's local app (WearOS, Mi Fit, etc.).

## 🌐 Our Solution

Our AI-powered Android app aggregates Google Fit, sleep, screen time, and music data to generate wellbeing scores and predict emotional states. It uses machine learning to detect early mental health patterns, providing personalized recommendations before crises occur.

WnW makes mental health tracking accessible and stigma-free for Indians by leveraging data users already generate and delivering culturally-sensitive insights via a private, smartphone-first experience.
